# SM64Paint
This program is in an early beta stage and can currently:
* Preview all levels within any uncompressed SM64 ROM (including mods)
* Attempt to force a geometry mode change from vector normal lighting to vertex RGBA shading and vice cersa
* Colour vertices from a palette selection
* Save ROM with all edited vertices
* Allow texture editing such as clamping and mirroring
* Allow RGBA16, RGBA32, CI4, IA4, IA8, IA16, I4, and I8 texture importing

Upcoming plans:
* Properly render environment mapping
* Optimise renderer and improve GUI
* CI8 and YUV16 texture importing 
* Properly render light vectors in proportion to camera view
